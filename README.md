# Fetch and async await API

> Find APIs with simple (and **FREE**) endpoints, preferably without having to _sign-up_ or other requirements.

My notes and code examples for getting API data using async & await with the fetch API. I will add RESTful APIs including the WordPress REST API at a later date.

> I love React for the ease of writing to the DOM, especially when you need to display lists!

## Files

1. `index.html` and `script.js` have the code for most of the APIs
1. `fetch.html` and `fetch.js` are from a YouTube series
1. Both html files use a basic `style.css` sheet
1. Practice files: 1. `sample.txt`, 2. `users.json`, 3. `ZonAnn.Ts+dSST.csv`
1. `FETCH_NOTES.md`: notes of the Fetch API, Async/Await, and refactoring Fetch to Async/Await - from many sources
1. `api-md-files` - markdown files for different categories of APIs and the code I used
1. `THE_DOM.md` - notes on DOM manipulation

Main source is the [Public APIS repo on GitHub](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

### Working APIS

Animals

1. Dog CEO - 1000's of image src strings inside `mesage`as an array
1. MeowFacts - Set number of text strings inside `data` as an array
1. PlaceKitten - `Blob` and returns a single image which you need to use as an image `src` value
1. Zoo Animals - a single object with props

Books

1. Gutendex -

> I could never account for all the diff prop names unless I can use a variable in the forEach loop which is defined somewhere else.
