# Fetch and async await API

> Find APIs with simple (and **FREE**) endpoints, preferably without having to _sign-up_ or other requirements.

My notes and code examples for getting API data using async & await with the fetch API. I will add RESTful APIs including the WordPress REST API at a later date.

I have function programming code examples for the various type of endpoints. Right now I am using `console.log()` for the data I fetch:

> I love React for the ease of writing to the DOM, especially when you need to display lists!

## Files

1. `index.html` and `script.js` have the code for most of the APIs
1. `fetch.html` and `fetch.js` are from a YouTube series
1. Both html files use a basic `style.css` sheet
1. Practice files: 1. `sample.txt`, 2. `users.json`, 3. `ZonAnn.Ts+dSST.csv`
1. `FETCH_NOTES.md`: notes of the Fetch API, Async/Await, and refactoring Fetch to Async/Await - from many sources
1. `API_NOTES.md`: a breakdown on each API I worked with showing endpoints, parameters and the code blocks I used to fetch the data.
